Upload the setup file to the server:
scp -i ~/.ssh/<key_name> setup_myWebsite.sh root@<server_ip>:/root/
Run the setup file:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<key_name> root@<server_ip>
chmod +x /root/setup_myWebsite.sh
./setup_myWebsite.sh

You can use that first command to upload other files also from the web_site folder.

Troubleshooting commands in case the script fails:
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
grep Port /etc/ssh/sshd_config
id www-data
ufw status
ps aux | grep nginx
systemctl status nginx
